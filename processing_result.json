Introduction\nThe infrastructure projects are important for development of a nation and are also a mirror of any country’s \ndevelopment. However, most of the infrastructure projects on account of their sheer size and nature (namely, \ntype, site/location, urban settling, etc.) are invariably accompanied by significant environmental and social \nimpacts during different phases (namely, pre-construction, construction and operational phase) of the \nproject. The nature of these impacts could be either positive or negative, depending upon their potential to \nfavourably or adversely affect the surrounding environment and also the resident community.Journal of Infrastructure Development  \n5(1) 67–86  \n© 2013 India Development Foundation  \nSAGE Publications  \nLos Angeles, London,  \nNew Delhi, Singapore,  \nWashington DC\nDOI: 10.1177/0974930613488296\nhttp://joi.sagepub.comArticle\n68  Niraj Sharma, Rajni Dhyani and S. Gangopadhyay\nJournal of Infrastructure Development, 5, 1 (2013): 67–86With increasing traffic demand, coupled with increasing number of vehicles on road, the problems \nrelated to traffic congestion, road accidents and environmental pollution have also increased significantly \nover the last few years in various urban centres around the world. One of the most accepted methods of \nimproving traffic and environmental conditions in these cities has been to provide an efficient public trans -\nportation system, so that the private vehicle owners are encouraged to shift to public transportation system \n(Fouracre et al. 2003). In case of developing countries like India, the public transportation system in most \nof the cities is grossly inadequate and can be considered inefficient as well as insufficient.\nIn order to improve the public transportation system, the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) have \nbeen provided or being planned in various parts of the world. Although most of the developed countries \nhave already provided MRTS in their major cities, the same is lacking in most of the cities in the devel -\noping countries, including India. Ideally, as the population of a city grows share of public transportation \n(road or rail based) should increase for a city. With a population of 1 or 2 million, the share of public \ntransportation should be about 50 per cent–60 per cent. Moreover the percentage share of public trans -\nport should progressively increase with the population growth of the city, and should reach about 75 per \ncent when the population of the city reaches the 5 million mark (Sekar and Karthigeyan 2009).\nSelection of a public transportation system on a corridor in the city, whether it should be road based \n(High Capacity Bus Systems [HCBS]) or rail-based (for example, metro rail, mono rail, etc.) primarily \ndepends on the traffic density during the peak hour(s) on that particular corridor. Experience from Indian \ncities have shown that under mixed traffic conditions, comprising slow and fast moving vehicles, road-\nbased public transportation system can optimally carry 8,000 persons per hour per direction (phpdt). \nWhen traffic density crosses that mark, traffic and environmental pollution related issues/problems \nincrease; under these circumstances provisions of a rail-based mass transit system (that is, a metro rail \nsystem) should be considered. However, when the traffic increases beyond 15,000 phpdt on a corridor, \nintroduction of metro rail system becomes unavoidable.\nMetro rail is a form of mass transit public transport system employing trains. The metro rail system, \nunlike conventional rail-based systems is grade separated from the other traffic or provided with separate \nright of way (ROW) to avoid conflict with other urban transportation networks. In most of the cases, at \nleast a portion of the rails are placed underground (in tunnels), while a major portion remains above \nground (elevated). The system is provided in an urban area and is mostly operated by electricity with \nhigh capacity and frequency.\nIn the present article, critical issues related to metro rail projects have been discussed, which directly \nor indirectly affect its execution, viability (technical as well as financial) and also justification vis-à-vis \nother public transportation systems. The Delhi metro rail being amongst the fastest growing metro rail \nnetworks in the world, these critical issues reflect the experience of the Delhi metro during different \nphases of the project. Some of these issues discussed in the Indian context are also applicable to other \ndeveloping as well as developed countries depending upon their unique social, environmental issues and \nexisting land-use pattern.\n2. Metro Rail Systems Around the World\nAt present there are 160 metro rail systems covering a total length of approximately 10,000 km, are \noperating throughout the world, mostly in Europe and North America. However, such metro rail systems \nare very few in the African continent which is also an indirect reflection of the development status of the \nMetro Rail Projects in India  69\nJournal of Infrastructure Development, 5, 1 (2013): 67–86region. The situation is far better in Asia. In fact, Asia is the region in which China and India are two \ncountries where the metro rail network is expanding very fast. In China, the metro rail is under construc -\ntion in 43 cities where the population is more than 1 million. China is aiming to construct a total of 1,500 \nkm of metro rail corridors by the year 2015. In India also, 15 major cities with a population more than 3 \nmillion have already been or are being provided with metro rail (with a total metro rail corridor length of \napproximately 750 km) and are under different stages of planning and/or construction. Metro rail sys -\ntems are being provided/introduced in these cities not only to provide an efficient public transportation \nsystem, but also to improve the urban traffic conditions, air and noise pollution situations there.\nThe ‘London Underground’ (11 lines, ~408 km in length) was the first metro rail system introduced \nin the year 1853; Shanghai city (China) has the largest passenger metro rail length (~425 km) with the \nhighest passenger ridership of 7.548 million passengers/day in the year 2010; the Delhi metro (India) is \nthe probably the fastest-growing metro rail network in the world (presently, ~190 km, passenger rider -\nship ~2.1 million passenger/day, another ~114 km (Phase III) planned for, to be completed by the year \n2017). When all four phases of the Delhi metro construction are completed in the year 2021, it will have \na total network length of more than 400 km with 8 lines.\nSalient features of some of the important metro rail systems presently operating in different parts \nof the world are presented in the Table 1 and compared with the Delhi Metro system. Throughout the \nworld, the popularity of metro rail systems as a means of an effective public transportation is increas -\ning. The increasing passenger ridership in these metro rail systems is an indicator of the same. The \npassenger ridership of some of the important metro rail systems operational in the world has been \npresented in Table 2.  In the context of the length of the metro rail corridor, the world average is that \nfor every 1 million population of a city, there are 19 km of metro lines. Against this world standard, \nIndia’s corresponding figure (~4 km/million) is very low.\nTable 1.

In fact, the Delhi Metro project is considered as the one of the biggest \nurban intervention in India since independence. Moreover, it is being constructed to world class stand -\nards with frontline technologies keeping in view the future requirements for upgradation. Apart from \nDelhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata, metro rail construction activities are in an advanced stage of construction \nin cities like Jaipur, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad. From Tables 1 and 2, it is clear that the Delhi \nmetro rail system compares well with other metro rail systems in the world in terms of total length, \nnumber of stations, km/station, km/line, station/line and metro ridership.\nFeasibility studies including preparation of a Detailed Project Report (DPR) and other technical stud -\nies in major cities of India, such as Navi Mumbai, Pune, Chandigarh, Kanpur, Ludhiana, Bhopal, Indore \nand Ahmadabad have already been completed and are in different stages of planning.\n3. Development of Metro Rail Corridors in Delhi\nThe Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC) is the body/authority in charge of the construction \nand operation of the metro rail system for Delhi (the capital city of India) and other National Capital \nRegion (NCR) areas surrounding the city of Delhi.

Phase-I (65.1 km) and Phase II (~114.5 km) have already been completed with a \ntotal cost of `30,171 crore (~ US$ 6 billion) (US$1 = ~ `50) and is presently operational. The preparation \nof DPR and other related technical and feasibility studies for Phase III of the total length of ~114 km \nhave already been completed. Phase III of the project is likely to start from April 2011 and is likely to be \ncompleted by the year 2016 (Table 3).\nThe expected cost of Phase III is likely to be ` ~35,242 crore (~7 billion US$). Phase IV (~108.50 km) \nis likely to be completed by the year 2021. A part of the Delhi metro Phase I and II project cost was \nfinanced by the Government of Japan through a soft loan from the Japan Bank of International Cooperation \n(JBIC) along with the central government of India and state government of Delhi. Also the remaining \nfund was internally generated by the Delhi metro through property development. The funding pattern for \nPhase III is likely to be similar to that of Phases I and II.\nTable 3.

Critical Issues\n4.1 Underground versus Elevated Corridor\nWhile the requirement for an efficient public transportation system like a metro rail system in Indian \ncities is no longer a matter of dispute, the question about whether these should be elevated or under -\nground has attracted a lot of attention and has generated spirited debate among various stakeholders, \nwith some even taking this issue to the courts of law. A few organisations representing the Resident \nWelfare Associations (RWAs) of residential colonies where these metro rail corridors are expected to \ncross or will be passing, opposed the elevated corridor because of their perceived concerns related to an \nincrease in noise pollution (including vibration) and privacy-related issues affecting their houses which \nare very close to the proposed/existing metro rail alignment (Chakraborty 2010). Further, the elevated \ncorridors are also opposed by a few town planners and others on plea that these elevated corridors will \nnot only adversely affect the aesthetics of the city, but will also reduce the visibility of various historical \nmonuments by obstructing the line of sight and will further increase concretisation of the whole city \nwhich might led to irreversible micro-climatic changes including increased heat-island effects.\nThe DMRC as well as central government (that is, the government of India) opposed the concept of \nproviding underground corridors throughout the alignment against the elevated corridors, except for the \ntechnical reasons such as alignment in Central Business District (CBD), where constructing the elevated \nMetro Rail Projects in India  73\nJournal of Infrastructure Development, 5, 1 (2013): 67–86corridor may not be feasible because of a large number of properties/buildings which might be affected \nand due to various technical difficulties which might occur during the construction phase of the project. \nThey also cited various financial and safety related concerns for not going underground, where there is \nsufficient techno-economical justification for metro rail corridor to go elevated.\nBased on DMRC’s (based on Delhi’s) experience, constructing an underground section is more than \ntwice expensive as constructing an equally long elevated section, their approximate cost in Delhi being \n`275 crore (~55 million US$) and `110 crore (~21 million US$) per km respectively (Kumar 2011) \n(Table 4). Similarly, the cost of construction of per km of underground and elevated corridor in Mumbai \nhas been estimated to be `635 crore (~126 million US$) and `235 crore (~46 million US$) (CSE \n2010).\nThe higher cost of metro corridors in Mumbai (as against the other Indian cities) is due to higher land \nacquisition costs and absence of various incentives/tax exemptions which the government has provided \nto other metro rail projects but not extended the same to Mumbai metro. The second factor in making a \nchoice between an elevated and underground metro rail corridor is technical feasibility. Wherever pos -\nsible, metro rail planners always prefer the elevated corridor to the underground metro corridor. This is \nbecause the engineering complexities and associated risks of cost and time overruns are much less for \nelevated stretches, as well as the operating costs of Metro rail when they are in operational phase \n(Sreedharan 2008). Further, many times underground stations and tunnels have to be built by the ‘cut and \ncover’ method, this may require far more land than an elevated stretch on road medians which may cause \nserious practical difficulties during the construction phase. Third, but definitely not the least, is the secu -\nrity aspect. Metro rails throughout the world, are always high on the hit list of terrorists because of the \npossible collateral damage and its likely psychological impacts. Any attack in the underground portion \nleading to derailment or collision is likely to cause five times more damage than an elevated one \n(Sreedharan 2008). Moreover, due to huge costs involved, it is usual to limit underground construction \nto congested central areas or proximity to archaeological structures or any other restriction which does \nnot permit elevated structures/historical monuments. In Delhi, underground corridors are mostly limited \nto the Central Business District (CBD) of Delhi or the old Delhi area, where there is no space for an \nelevated corridor being so congested and having narrow lanes. Thus, despite the high cost, underground \nmetro corridors have been provided only due to technical reasons such as practical difficulties in carry -\ning out above-surface construction activities in busy and congested CBD areas, problems in acquiring \nTable 4.

In fact, the figure of underground corri -\ndors in the Delhi metro are quite comparable to other metro rail systems operating in other parts of the \nworld, including the London Metro (44 per cent of the 408 km), San Francisco (USA) (29 per cent of 115 \nkm). In metropolitan cities of Asia including Hong Kong (87.7 km), Kuala Lumpur (72 km), Singapore \n(89.4 km), Dubai (67 km), a substantial portion of the corridor is elevated (Table 5). In some metro rail \nsystems operating in various developed countries, where there is a substantial portion (>60 per cent) of the \ncorridors that are underground (for example, New York (60 per cent of 371 km), Chicago (USA) (66 per \ncent of 183 km), etc.), the first choice had always been to provide elevated corridors and underground sec -\ntions/corridors are provided only due to technical reasons (Sreedharan 2008). In India, such as Mumbai, \nBangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmadabad, Ludhiana, etc., the proportion of elevated corridors are likely to be \nsignificantly more than what has been or is being provided in Delhi due to similar reasons.\nMoreover, as these metro rail corridors/projects are mostly public-funded projects, financed by the \ngovernment, these projects cannot be provided unlimited financial support at the cost of other infrastruc -\nture projects. Thus, these metro rail projects always have to work with financial and budget constraints. \nProviding 1 km of underground section equals 2.5–3.0 km on the surface in terms of cost, which is equal \nto 1.5–2 km less metro rail corridor for every km of underground section due to budgetary constraints. \nThis may result in a large population of a city still being without a reliable, comfortable and environ -\nment-friendly public transport system such as a metro rail system. Thus, elevated versus underground \ncorridor issues can be resolved keeping in view technical considerations only, whereas other issues like \navailability of funds/resources, safety issues along with socio-economic considerations, although very \nimportant, should come later while arriving at the final solution/selection of the corridor.S.  \nNo. PhaseLength (Km) (%)\nAt Grade Elevated Underground Total\nCalcutta/Kolkata Metro\n1.

Gangopadhyay\nJournal of Infrastructure Development, 5, 1 (2013): 67–864.2 Over-estimation of Traffic Demand Forecasts/Ridership Estimation\nFinancial viability of any transportation projects (road-based, rail-based or a combination of these two) \ngreatly depends upon the accuracy of traffic demand forecasts/ridership estimation. These forecasts not \nonly provide a technical justification for these projects but also a guide and tool for their socio-economic \nand environmental appraisal vis-à-vis their projected/estimated costs and benefits. However, most of \nthese forecasting/modelling exercises for transportation projects rarely provide a true picture, often lead -\ning to inaccurate or sometimes even a misleading picture about the project, forcing the decision/policy \nmakers to take a wrong or flawed decision. In the context of metro rail projects, an over-estimation of the \nridership figure leads to over-sizing and underutilisation of the infrastructure/resources leading to over-\ninvesting in idle capacity resulting in financial mismanagement or crisis for the project. On the other \nside, an underestimation of traffic demand/ridership estimation leads to chaos and inefficiency and ulti -\nmately a significant further investment as adding capacity to an existing facility is much more costlier \nthan building the whole capacity/infrastructure in one go.\nIn a significant study carried out by Flyvbjerg et al. (2006), covering 210 transportation projects \n(including both rail- and road-based) in 14 nations in developed as well as developing countries, indi -\ncated a very poor traffic demand forecasting with a very high statistical significance. The study con -\ncluded that there is a tendency for traffic forecasts to be overestimated. According to the study, the causes \nfor inaccuracy in forecasts were different for rail and road projects, with political causes playing a \ngreater role in rail projects than road projects. One of the noticeable findings of the study regarding fore -\ncasting of rail and road projects was the observation that rail passenger forecasts are highly systematic \nand significantly misleading and are much more inaccurate and biased (inflated) than road traffic fore -\ncasts. The study found that nine out of the 10 rail projects’ passenger forecasts are overestimated; the \naverage over-estimation is 106 per cent. For 72 per cent of the rail projects, forecasts are overestimated \nby more than two-thirds. On the other side, for 50 per cent of the road projects, the difference between \nactual and forecast traffic is more than ±20 per cent; for 25 per cent of road projects, the difference is \nlarger than ±40 per cent. Since large sums of money and other scarce resources are being invested in \ncreating transport infrastructure, especially in developing economies, it is important to avoid transporta -\ntion projects, which fail to provide expected benefits in terms of traffic or passenger ridership. Litman \n(2010) further recommended more appropriate indicators of transit system performance. It says that for \nreliability of ridership forecasts, ridership should be categorised by year (for example, pre-1990, 1990–99 \nand 2000+) to see if predictions improved over time.\nDemand forecasts for metro rail projects in Indian cities have also not been accurate. In the Kolkata \nmetro rail, the annual passenger volume estimated was 623.7 million trips for the year 2000, however, \nthe actual number of passenger trips on the metro railway during 1999–2000 was only 55.8 million, \nwhich is approximately one-eleventh of the estimated traffic 10 years ago in 1990 (Advani and Tiwari \n2007). In the case of the Chennai metro rail, according to the MRTS authorities there, it has a capacity \nto ferry some six hundred thousand commuters daily; however, the service has been attracting only \naround 25,000 passengers per day, and most of them during peak hours. Similarly, expected ridership \nof the Delhi metro rail has been modified several times since the commencement of the project in year \n2002. The DMRC had initially expected ridership of metro rail to be 1.5 million passenger trips per \nday (ppd) for 2005, which was further reduced to 0.7 million ppd by March, 2006. Advani and Tiwari \n(2007) also pointed out that, ridership on Line 1 of the Phase I in April 2004 was 0.12 million ppd and \n0.13 million ppd in July 2005. Ridership of Line 2 in July 2005 was 0.24 million ppd indicating that \nMetro Rail Projects in India  77\nJournal of Infrastructure Development, 5, 1 (2013): 67–86after completion of around 57 per cent of Phase I, ridership was 0.37 million ppd which was only 20 \nper cent of the estimated ridership. In fact, metro ridership figures were revised, as the feasibility \nreports (prepared on behalf of DMRC) had actually estimated much higher ridership (RITES 1995)  \nthan what was actually observed ( Hindustan Times  2010) for various years (Table 6). Thus, empirical \nevidence from Indian cities and a study by Flyvbjerg et al. (2006)  make a strong case for critical analy -\nses of the travel demand forecasts.\n4.3 Land/Property Acquisition and Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) Related Issues\nMetro cities of developing countries throughout the world are densely populated with little availability \nof land for such mega infrastructure project. Land/property acquisition has always been an integral part \nof any mega infrastructure developmental project. Efforts are always made to minimise the land/property \nacquisition as to minimise its socio-economic impacts. The land/property acquisition in some areas \nalong the metro corridors sometimes becomes inevitable no other option related to alternate alignment \nrequiring less R&R impacts is feasible due to technical reasons (including those related to ridership), \nenvironmental considerations and financial constraints. The issue of land/property acquisition is a pre-\nconstruction phase activity, for which proper socio-economic and R&R surveys need to be carried out to \ndetermine the project affected persons/families.\nIn Delhi, most of the elevated metro corridors are provided along existing roads or the medians of the \nroads which are mostly owned by the government/government agencies so that the various impacts \nrelated to land/property acquisition are the minimum. Providing/suggesting metro rail corridors on the \ncentral verge/median and/or at one side of existing road corridors ensures that there is no or very mini -\nmum additional land acquired by using the existing ROW of the road for metro rail corridors. In CBD \nTable 6.

Gangopadhyay\nJournal of Infrastructure Development, 5, 1 (2013): 67–86areas and archeologically sensitive areas the metro rail corridor goes underground. Many times some \nland is acquired temporarily for material storage or to facilitate safety during the construction phase. In \nthese situations, apart from providing adequate compensation, the acquired land is returned back to the \nowner/owning agencies after its restoration. The metro rail project implementing agency also ensures \nrehabilitation of the affected persons by providing them alternate sites/facilities/commercial rehabilita -\ntion. Thus, land acquisition for metro rail projects like any other similar transportation-related infrastruc -\nture projects is inevitable. However, it should be kept to a minimum by adopting suitable route alignment \nand by employing the latest construction techniques/methods which reduce the material and land/prop -\nerty requirements/acquisitions, which may not only avoid possible confrontation/social unrest with \naffected persons but will also result in a reduced overall cost of the project, affecting the financial viabil -\nity of the project.\n4.4 Loss of Trees/Green Cover\nDuring the construction phase of metro rail projects, many times trees have to be cut, resulting in the loss \nof green cover along the metro rail corridors. Most of these trees are part of roadside/linear plantation on \nthe median and/or on the sides of existing road(s). The loss of tree/green cover may cause micro-climatic \nchanges and affects the aesthetics of the area. As per the estimates, the DMRC has felled 25,507 trees over \nPhase I and II of its construction in Delhi. The DMRC has carried out compensatory afforestation (10 trees \nfor every tree cut), as per the provisions of the Delhi (Preservation of Trees) Act, 1994. About 30 per cent \nof the trees on various metro rail corridors have been saved through proper care and planning in route align -\nment. Department of Forests, Government of Delhi (the nodal agency) is planting trees on behalf of the \nDMRC on the land allocated on the outskirts of Delhi. It is always debatable that while trees are cut at the \nproject site, their compensatory afforestation has been carried out on the outskirts of Delhi far away from \nthe project site because of the unavailability of land for growing new trees. It is desirable and should be \nensured that the afforestation is carried near the project site itself whenever possible in consultation with \nlocal authorities/department. Sometimes even underground corridors are also proposed to prevent the loss \nof trees cover (for example, the Ridge area of Delhi, considered as the lungs of Delhi).\n4.5 Noise Pollution and Vibration Issues\nNoise and vibration-related issues along the corridor(s) are one of the major issues which may be signifi -\ncant during both the construction as well as the operational phase of the project. During the construction \nphase, the use of heavy machinery and construction equipment may cause vibrations and also increase \nthe ambient noise levels. Vibrations generated during the construction phase may have several adverse \nimpacts, including cracks developed on the surrounding buildings which can have serious implications \non the structural safety.\nDuring the operation of the metro rail, rail–wheel contacts with tracks generate noise and vibration. \nEngine, cooling fans and generators further increase ambient noise and vibration levels inside the coaches \nand also outside the metro rail corridor.\nWorldwide, several efforts are being made to reduce the impact of noise and vibration generated by \nthe metro rails, both at the source as well as receptor levels. Delhi Metro is using new and advance \nMetro Rail Projects in India  79\nJournal of Infrastructure Development, 5, 1 (2013): 67–86technology in rails and brake systems, namely, by providing damping wheels and tracks, reducing the \nroughness of the rails; and noise levels can be further reduced by providing mass spring system technology \nand noise barriers along the corridor at critical locations along the corridor.\nCoaches with advanced sound-absorbing cushions lining on the walls with better buffing have been \nprovided so that the doors will seal perfectly reducing sound filtering in from outside. Apart from con -\ntrolling the internal noise levels, the Delhi metro runs on a ‘ballastless tracks’ technology. The integra -\ntion of turnouts into ‘Long Welded Rails (LWR)’ further ensures that complete tracks are virtually ‘joint \nless’ which, besides lower maintenance cost and higher safety, promises minimal vibration and greater \nriding comfort for passengers. Various (CRRI 2009a) studies have also highlighted the increased noise \nlevels along the elevated corridors under situations like ‘rail-under-a-road’ situations, where noise gener -\nated by the existing road traffic is further increased (up to 3 dB(A)) due to reflection of noise because of \nthe pillars and canopy of the elevated track. However, this issue is being taken care of by various metro \nrail agencies including by using noise absorbing construction material, by providing silencers spanning \na metro line running over bridges and designing structures in such a way that the reflection of the noise \ncan be minimised.\n4.6 Accidents During Construction Phase\nIdeally, no accidents during construction should take place. However, during the construction of com -\nplex structures such as metro rail corridors, which involve the use of huge machinery and equipment,  \nsome freak fatal accidents are always a possibility. The accidents may occur due to human errors/negli -\ngence, mechanical failure of machinery, design faults, use of low-quality construction materials and also \ndue to man-made and natural disasters like earthquakes, flooding, fire and deliberate sabotage and ter -\nrorist activities. Development of a safety culture at all levels, close monitoring and supervision by trained \nengineers, proper designing of the structures and its verification by another independent agency, quality \nchecks of the construction materials and ‘no tolerance’ towards the negligence can ensure a high level of \nsafety during the construction period. Advanced technology should be used so that human exposure and \nfaults arising due to human error can be avoided.\nA few accidents have been reported in the Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru metros during the ongoing \nconstruction phase. Large numbers of workers and machinery are involved in the construction: DMRC \nhad employed 250–300 cranes daily and the numbers of workers engaged in those activities were \n35,000–40,000 everyday for Phase II projects. However, a few accidents on DMRC corridors during the \nconstruction of Phase II have brought the concerns related to accidents during construction into the lime -\nlight. Although, the DMRC accident rate is still very low as compared to International standards \n(Singapore has 1.1 accidents/million men–hours, the London Underground has 0.32 accidents/million \nmen–hours as compared to DMRC’s 0.4 accidents/million men–hours) .\nIn the Delhi metro, 109 construction workers have been killed, since the metro started construction 12 \nyears ago (Pandit 2010). The DMRC argues that though a lot of hype is being created about the ‘increased’ \naccidents during construction of Phase II, in fact it was Phase I which witnessed more fatal accidents (55 \ndeaths in 65.1 km against 47 so far in Phase II, ~114 km). In fact, safety during construction is all about \nensuring proper project execution through strict compliance to quality norms and formulating a detailed \nproject management strategy including its execution in the field.\n80  Niraj Sharma, Rajni Dhyani and S. Gangopadhyay\nJournal of Infrastructure Development, 5, 1 (2013): 67–864.7 Traffic Issues during Construction Phase\nMost of the metro rail corridors (especially elevated corridors) are being built along the existing roads or \nwithin the existing ROW of the roads. As a result, traffic needs to be diverted temporarily (or only a narrow \nwidth of the existing road is allowed to be used for traffic flow) for carrying out construction activities \nsmoothly and to avoid any accident involving construction machinery/equipment. This diversion of road \ntraffic further from the existing road corridors increases the traffic loads on the adjoining roads leading to \ncongestion and traffic jams during peak hours during the construction phase of the project. The situation \nmay be further aggravated during the monsoon season due to water logging problems at the project site. \nTraffic diversion plans, including barricading of the project site (that is, the portion of the existing road \nwhich needs to be taken over temporarily), needs to be implemented in consultation with traffic police and \nlocal authorities before the start of the construction activities. The public should also be made aware of \nthese diversions/closures well in advance to avoid inconvenience. As per the policy of DMRC in Delhi, the \nroad portion taken over by it temporarily, is returned back to the road owning agency and after the comple -\ntion of the construction activities and after its complete restoration; sometimes in better conditions than the \noriginal road conditions, when it was taken over by metro rail agency.\n4.8 Metro Rail versus Bus Rapid Transit System (MRTS vs. BRTS)\nMetro Rail and Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTS) (also known as High Capacity Bus Systems (HCBS)), \nare the two most popular public transport systems which are increasingly being used successfully \nthroughout the world. Introduction of a BRT system on selected corridors in some selected cities are also \nbeing introduced so that travelling by the public transportation buses becomes more attractive as com -\npared to commuting by private vehicles. With the successful implementation of the Bogota (Colombia) \nBRTS and in different cities of the developed world, the BRT system is also being implemented in dif -\nferent cities in India with a mixed degree of success.\nIn India, BRT corridors are already present in cities like Pune, Ahmadabad, Delhi, Mumbai and \nIndore and are being expanded further. Moreover in India, BRTS has been proposed for cities like, \nRajkot, Bhopal, Pimpri Chinchwad, Vijaywada, Vizag and Jaipur.\nIn Delhi, the execution and operation of BRTS on selected corridors have lead to a lot of public criti -\ncism and also generated an intense debate between the Metro Rail and Bus Rapid Transit System (that \nis, MRTS vs BRTS). During the trial run on a selected corridor in Delhi, several technical and opera -\ntional difficulties such as the malfunctioning of signalling systems, bus operation related issues (that is, \nlow frequency, untrained drivers, slow speed, etc.), undisciplined private vehicular traffic (that is, lack \nof traffic discipline), jaywalking of pedestrians, absence of supporting infrastructure (for example, park -\ning facilities and foot over-bridges (FOB) or subways, etc., emerged (DIMTS 2009). In fact even before \nthe BRTS was implemented on that particular stretch in Delhi, the road which was divided into six lanes \nwas experiencing very heavy traffic volumes for most part of the day. As a matter of fact, the stretch \nneeded to be widened to handle that traffic volume even before the BRT idea was implemented. But, \ninstead of adding width, two lanes were taken out of the corridor for the purpose of providing separate \ndedicated lanes for BRTS. As a result, BRTS has taken up almost one-third of the road space leaving very \nlittle space for general traffic. While critically evaluating the system in Delhi, it was also pointed out by \nvarious experts that the passenger carrying capacity in Bogotá (Columbia) BRTS corridor (which is a \nsuccess story and is always referred to by various traffic engineers and transportation planners) is higher \nMetro Rail Projects in India  81\nJournal of Infrastructure Development, 5, 1 (2013): 67–86due to more road space given to cars. However, after a lot of redesigning and traffic management meas -\nures, these problems have been controlled to a large extent and a further 15 new BRT corridors, spanning \n359.9 km, have been planned.\nWorldwide, there is intense debate between BRTS and MRTS in terms of their effectiveness as a \npublic transportation system vis-à-vis cost of their implementation in any urban city. In comparison to \nBRTS, the metro rail corridor occupies no road space, if underground and only about 2 m width of the \nroad if elevated. Moreover, it carries the same amount of traffic as 9 lanes of bus traffic or 33 lanes of \nprivate motor cars (either way) and also consumers approximately 50 per cent less energy/passenger \ncarried as compared to BRTS. Further, metro rail is considered to be more reliable, comfortable and safer \nthan road-based systems and reduces journey time by anything between 50 per cent and 75 per cent \ndepending on road conditions (Kumar 2011). However,  metro rail projects are highly capital-intensive \nprojects and cost of per km of the corridor is significantly higher in comparison to per km of a BRTS \ncorridor (that is, ~ `50–100 crores or US$ 1–20 million). However, it is argued that in the case of metro \nrail, the operator has to bear the entire cost of infrastructure such as the civil cost (electrical and mechani -\ncal) and rolling stock cost in addition to the entire (operating and maintenance) cost. On the other hand, \nin a road-based system, the operator has to bear only the cost of transport vehicles and their operating \nand maintenance cost. The infrastructure cost of building roads, maintenance of roads, lighting, etc., are \nmostly borne by the city or city government. Therefore, if the cost of road transportation in a system like \nBRTS has to be compared vis-à-vis a Metro rail, the road-based system should also include the propor -\ntionate cost of infrastructure and its maintenance (Litman 2009, 2010). A comparison between MRTS \nand BRTS has been summarised in the Table 7.\nFrom the Table 7, it is clear that MRTS has several advantages vis-à-vis BRTS. Critics generally argue \nthat most of the above facts favouring MRTS vis-à-vis BRTS are based on the ‘general perception’ \ndevoid of any real facts, which is strongly opposed by other researchers/proponents arguing in favour of \nMRTS (Litman 2010).\nTable 7.

While, many argue that \norganisations like DMRC in Delhi and similar organisations in other parts of the country, who have \nbeen entrusted the job of construction and operation of metro rail system(s), should not be allowed to \nventure into property development business like any other real estate agency/developers, when the \nland to these agencies have been given to them at concessional rates. It is also argued that these imple -\nmenting agencies, which have been given land/property along the corridors on concessional rates, are \nfocussing more on profit generation by the way of real estate development and commercial use of the \nMetro Rail Projects in India  83\nJournal of Infrastructure Development, 5, 1 (2013): 67–86land/space at metro stations to earn profiles like any other real estate developers/agency. It is sug -\ngested by many to leave this activity to nodal agencies and other private estate developers, who are \nspecifically assigned or doing that particular job.\nThese metro rail agencies have always argued that the earnings from the property developments have \nbeen mandated by the government to finance various on-going projects/activities related to property \ndevelopment/commercial use of property along the metro corridors are not unique for DMRC in Delhi \nor any other part of India or even in the world. With escalating costs of construction and operation of \nmetro rail corridor projects, coupled with reducing financial support from the government and other \ninternational agencies, property development and commercial use of property is the only resource by \nwhich the metro rail projects and their operations can be sustained in the long run without compromising \nthe main objective of providing a safe, economical and comfortable mode of public transportation with \nless dependence on the government for financial help.\nIn fact, the Delhi metro is amongst the only three metro systems in the world, which does not need \nany financial subsidy from the government and derives financial support from its property development \nprogrammes . In fact, Phase-I of the Delhi metro had provided 7 per cent of the project cost upfront and \n30 per cent of the recurring income. At present, ~25–30 per cent of the annual revenue of the Delhi metro \ncomes from commercial property developments in the metro station complexes, advertisements and \nother commercial activities, which is equal to or even less than other metro rail systems operating in dif -\nferent parts of the world. The Hong Kong metro which is one of the few profit-making MRTS in whole \nworld, has (up to) 35–40 per cent of its revenue coming from such non-operating sources. Any efforts to \ndrastically reduce or bring down the share of non-operating revenue sources from the total income would \nrequire further rationalisation of passenger fare structures in such a way that it earns more passengers \nwithout compromising the metro ridership and thus passenger revenue growth which will further require \npassenger preference/fare analysis for metro rail vis-à-vis other modes of public transportation.\n4.10 Quantification of Benefits Due to Implementation of Metro Rail Projects\nIn the recent past, there has been a lot of debate and questions have been raised regarding the justifica -\ntion of investment in such capital intensive projects for solving traffic and transportation problems, \nwhen there may be other ‘less costly systems/options/alternatives’ available with similar levels of \nservice (Advani and Tiwari 2005; Cox 2000; Cox and Utt 2010; CRRI 2006, 2009b; Fouracre et al. \n2003; Litman 2010; Murty et al. 2006). To justify the huge investment of public money, benefits \nexpected from the metro rail system(s) are quantified vis-à-vis expenditure/investment made on it. In \nfact, in most of this cost–benefit analysis, benefits accruing due to the proposed metro rail projects/\nsystem are estimated based on various assumptions (related to expected benefits) which are likely to \noccur after the implementation of the project. Unfortunately, no serious efforts have been made to \nrealistically estimate the expected benefits and validate these expected benefits (theoretical assump -\ntions) vis-à-vis actual field realities (that is, actual benefits accruing after the introduction of metro rail \nprojects). Moreover, it is not always possible (rather difficult) to quantify these impacts/benefits and \nconvert the same into economic terms.\nA few studies (CRRI 2006, 2009b; Murty et al. 2006) have been carried out in India, particularly in \nDelhi (for Phase I of the metro rail system). In a study carried out by CRRI (CRRI 2009b) based on the \nmetro ridership of ~0.85 million passengers (in 2009), has estimated that the introduction of metro rail \n84  Niraj Sharma, Rajni Dhyani and S. Gangopadhyay\nJournal of Infrastructure Development, 5, 1 (2013): 67–86has resulted in an average of 57,953 vehicles off the road each day and reduced 51 fatal accidents across \nthe metro rail corridor. The study further indicated that the entire cost of Delhi metro’s Phase I (that is \n`10,571 crores) (~2 billion US$) will be recovered by 2011, if the social benefits of the project are taken \ninto account along with direct and indirect environmental benefits, including the cost of fuel saving, \nreduced emissions/pollution levels, value of time saved and reduced expenditure on the maintenance of \nthe roads in the metro influence area.\n4.11 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Opportunities in MRTS Projects\nTransportation projects involving improvement in vehicle fuel efficiency by introducing new technolo -\ngies, changes in vehicle and/or fuel type, changing to less carbon intensive means of transport and reduc -\ning the frequency of transport activities are covered under CDM and are entitled for ‘Carbon Credits’ as \nper the Kyoto Protocol.\nIn fact, CO2 emission reduction from various MRTS projects like metro rail can also be utilised to \nearn ‘Carbon Credits’ by developing countries like India through the Clean Development Mechanism \n(CDM) as per the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol (1997), which became effective from the year 2005 \n(Sharma et al. 2010). MRTS projects like Delhi metro provide huge potential of reducing CO2 emissions \nalong with conventional vehicular emissions like PM, CO, HC, NOx, etc., by shifting of commuters \nfrom other modes to a more efficient public transportation system like metro rail system. At present, only \na few public transportation projects including metro rail projects have been registered under CDM and \nthe Delhi metro is the only railway/metro railway system in the world which has been awarded 4,00,000 \ncarbon credits for a 10-year period by the United Nations. The DMRC has been certified to have pre -\nvented over 90,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere by reducing its \npower requirement by adopting regenerative braking system.\nThe major reasons for the non-registration of more of the transportation sector being unavailability of \nappropriate approved methodologies for estimation of GHG/CO2 reductions, difficulty in establishing \nbaselines (that is, what would have happened in the absence of the proposed project, lack of authentic \nand proper data availability regarding the baseline?), inability to integrate various transportation projects \nas a part of a larger focus on sustainable development. There is an urgent need to develop appropriate \nmethodologies including that for estimation of CO2 emissions due to shifting of commuters, getting it as \nan ‘Approved Methodology’ from the UNFCC so that the project becomes eligible for CDM. Estimation \nof emission gains along with the quantification of fuel saving, etc., will have decision makers to take an \n‘informed policy decision’ and to justify the implementation cost of the MRTS and to know how its \nexecution has helped in the reduction of CO2 due to shifting of commuters from other modes of transpor -\ntation to MRTS. In this connection a methodology based on the Metro ridership data has been suggested \n(Sharma et al. 2010) which can be used for estimating CO2 reduction potential from MRTS projects.\n5. Concluding Remarks\nConstruction of the metro rail system in Delhi and other cities of India (as well as other parts of the world) \nhave brought out several important environmental, social and other related critical issues which need to be \nstudied and addressed carefully to make these mega infrastructure projects not only environmentally and \nMetro Rail Projects in India  85\nJournal of Infrastructure Development, 5, 1 (2013): 67–86socially acceptable but also technically and financially viable. These metro rail projects are capital inten -\nsive projects and mostly implemented in large cities where the high cost of construction can be justified \nby the accrued, direct and indirect benefits. Moreover, metro rail networks have to be constructed/built \nin very difficult urban settings so that there is the least inconvenience to the general public. Various \nstructures to be built should be aesthetic and merge with the surroundings.\nThere is always a debate regarding the justification of introducing a metro rail system vis-à-vis other \npublic transportation system(s) in an urban area (Cox 2000; Cox and Utt 2010; O’Toole 2010). Various \ncritics argue that these metro rail projects are very costly, subsidised, require excessive land use densi -\nties, are generally ineffective in solving most of the transportation problems and favour rich people. \nHowever, a study carried out by Litman (2010) has concluded that most of these arguments/criticism of \nrail projects are not based on the actual facts rather based on omissions, errors misrepresentations and \nintentional bias of data/figure. It was argued that if various benefits (namely, congestion reduction, pol -\nlution reduction, vehicle kilometre travelled (VKT), etc.) are considered individually then the cost of the \nmetro rail projects will definitely be higher as compared to other public transportation system but if these \nbenefits are combined together then metro rail projects are least costly vis-à-vis other public transporta -\ntion project (Litman 2010). Metro rail projects take many years to get operational. During initial years, \nridership is small as people take some time to change their transportation preference, thus accrued ben -\nefits are generally very small during initial years and as the time passes and various teething problems \nassociated with the operation of metro rail are resolved and the reach (that is, length of the corridor) \nincreases, the ridership also grows resulting in increased benefits vis-à-vis cost of the project.\nA public transportation system can only be successful if it encourages the commuters to shift from \ntheir private vehicles to this system. A good public transportation system should ideally be a combination \nof various public transportation systems (for example, metro rail, mono rail, HCBS, etc.). Public trans -\nportation systems instead of competing with each other should be complimentary to each other. It requires \nan integrated approach from the design stage itself. Further, experience gained from similar projects \nfrom other countries on various aspects related to construction, operation and environmental manage -\nment can also be suitably used for any project to ensure that they are environmentally sustainable as well \nas socially acceptable.\nReferences\nAdvani, M. and G.
